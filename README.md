# MSMD

An educational program intended to make learning more efficient. MSMD allows the vocabulary and the mechanics of a piece of knowledge or process to be learned while playing a game. Learning the vocabulary is the most tedious part of learning. MSMD makes this part of the learning process fun by turning it into a racing game.

## Developers / Contributors
MSMD is built on top of the [fman build system](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs)

Must use Python 3.6.  Later versions of python are not supported
