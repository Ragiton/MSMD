# MSMD

An educational program intended to make learning more efficient. MSMD allows the vocabulary and the mechanics of a piece of knowledge or process to be learned while playing a game. Learning the vocabulary is the most tedious part of learning. MSMD makes this part of the learning process fun by turning it into a racing game.

## Developers / Contributors
MSMD is built on top of the [fman build system](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs)

PyAudio is also used but is not compatible with python 3.7.  A wheel file will need to be installed in order to successfully install PyAudio. (see notes.txt)
