10/20/19 - PyAudio does not support python version 3.7 or later.  Had to download wheel file from this link to get it to work.

This does not work on mac (link only has binaries for windows). Had to revert to python 3.6

Problem is related to this PyInstaller Issue: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4130
	Workaround described in issue also solved my problem.
