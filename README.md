# MSMD

An educational program intended to make learning more efficient. MSMD allows the vocabulary and the mechanics of a piece of knowledge or process to be learned while playing a game. Learning the vocabulary is the most tedious part of learning. MSMD makes this part of the learning process fun by turning it into a racing game.
